# Weather-Aware-Outfit-Planner

A decision-making system that recommends daily outfits for a 7-day period based on weather conditions. Because weather forecasts are uncertain and outfit choices affect future comfort and variety, this is modeled as an MDP. The MDP computes an optimal policy for selecting outfits across the week to maximize comfort and minimize repetition, even when the weather changes unexpectedly.
